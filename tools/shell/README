This is a branch of the tutorial shell, which should develop into a full blown
SAGA shell over time.  That should allow us to keep the tutorial shell simple
and focused on, well, tutorialinging.  

Please remember to merge important fixes and new functionality back into the
tutorial shell (both solution and non-solution!).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following commands are available:

  // namespace related
  # pwd
  # cd            <dir>
  # ls
  # cp            <source> <target>
  # mv            <source> <target>
  # rm            <file>
  # ln            <source> <target>
  # mkdir         <dir>
  # rmdir         <dir>

  // file related
  # cat           <file>

  // logical file related
  # rep_find      <pat> [<key=val> ...]
  # rep_list
  # rep_add       <logical file> <url>
  # rep_remove    <logical file> <url>
  # rep_update    <logical file> <old> <new>
  # rep_replicate <logical file> <target>

  // job related
  # run           <exe>
  # ps
  # suspend       <job>
  # resume        <job>
  # kill          <job>
  # status        <job>

  // shell internals
  # set           <key> <val>
  # help
  # exit

The initial values for starting directory and default job
manager are set as environment variable.  Below are the default:

  setenv SAGA_SHELL_ROOT     file://localhost//tmp
  setenv SAGA_SHELL_CONTACT  fork://localhost/

The file env_local.csh sets these defaults, the file
env_globus.csh shows an example of Globus settings.  Sourcing
these files before running the shell shows nicel that SAGA-A is
adaptive to the environment.
