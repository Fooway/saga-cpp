(1) Making The tests
================================================================================
Run the make command:
make


(2) Running the tests
================================================================================

Run the tests with default config (all adaptors, url, verbose output)
make check or ./test_saga


(3) Run the tests with custom config
================================================================================

./test_saga [config_file]


(4) Creating a config_file
================================================================================

Overall test preferences are under the section
[test_perferences]

With the only option currently supported is
 verbose - When set to true, sets environment variable SAGA_VERBOSE

To test urls, configure the url_test section
[url_test]

With the only option
 enable - when set to true, enables url tests


Each package has their own section.  For instance, the file package's adaptor:
[file_adaptor_test]

And a properties section:
[file_adaptor_test.properties]

FILE:
 Valid sections under each section are package specific, let's examine one at a time:
 enabled         - Determines if this section will be parsed by the test.
 enabled_file    - Determines if the file test are to be run (namely saga::filesystem::files)
 enabled_dir     - Determines if the adaptors implementaton of directories are to be tests
 adaptor_name    - name of adaptor, for example: libsaga_adaptor_default_file.so -> default_file
 adaptor_path    - path to location of adaptor library

 Valid file_adaptor_test properties
 scheme          - scheme to set urls to before running tests
                   On a side note, this is also used by saga if the adaptor is not test aware
 host            - host to set urls to before running tests
                   On a side note, this is also used by saga if the adaptor is not test aware

JOB:
 valid sections under job package
 enabled         - determines if job tests are to be run
 adaptor_name    - name of adaptor, for example: libsaga_adaptor_default_file.so -> default_file
 adaptor_path    - path to location of adaptor library

 valid job_adaptor_test properties
 test_helper     - location to executable designed to help the test (included in test directory)
 scheme          - scheme to run jobs under (defaults: any)
 host            - host to run jobs under (defaults: localhost)

LOGICAL FILES:
 Valid sections under logical_file package
 enabled         - Determines if this section will be parsed by the test.
 enabled_file    - Determines if the logical_files are to be run
 enabled_dir     - Determines if the adaptors implementaton of logical_directories are to be tests
 adaptor_name    - name of adaptor, for example: libsaga_adaptor_default_file.so -> default_file
 adaptor_path    - path to location of adaptor library

 Valid logical_file properties
 Currently none supported

STREAM:
 valid sections under stream package
 enabled         - determines if stream tests are to be run
 adaptor_name    - name of adaptor, for example: libsaga_adaptor_default_file.so -> default_file
 adaptor_path    - path to location of adaptor library

 valid job_adaptor_test properties
 scheme          - scheme to manage stream with
 host            - host to manage stream with
 port            - port to manage stream with


(5) Setting config file for specific adaptors
================================================================================

Under each section for a package that an adaptor fulfills, set the path
and name of the adaptor accordingly.  For example, if you were setting
up a tests of the default file adaptor:

[file_adaptor_test]
...
adaptor_name = default_file
adaptor_path = /developing/adaptors/default_file

The adaptor name will be appended to look as follows
libsaga_adaptor_[adaptor_name].[shared library extension]

Other properties apply as described in the README
To guarantee that the adaptor is using the correct scheme and host 
to function properly, the config file allows the user to set this 
directly under the properties section.  Continuing under the same example:

[file_adaptor_test.adaptor_name.properties]
adaptor_path = /developing/adaptors/default_file
scheme = file
host   = localhost

Where adaptor_name is specific for each adaptor needed by the test.
The adaptor_path is needed in both sections

The urls to be generated by the adaptor (or in some cases by the test,
if the adaptor has not implemented the test helper class) will have
the host and scheme set to the above values
ex.  /tmp/file_XX -> file://localhost/temp/file_XX

Note:
If you are testing just one adaptor, it is probably best to disable all other test.
