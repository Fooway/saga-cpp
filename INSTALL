                            SAGA C++ Core Libraries  
                    - The Simple API for Grid Applications -
                          http://www.saga-project.org


  o The latest version can be found on the SAGA project website:
    http://saga-project.org/download

  o For detailed informations on how to install SAGA, please refer to 
    the documentation section on the SAGA website:
    http://saga-project.org/documentation/installation

  
  PREREQUISISTES:

  o C++ compiler (e.g. gcc/g++ >= 3.4)

  o GNU make >= 3.80
  
  o Boost C++ Libraries >= 1.33
    You need to have the Boost C++ libraries installed on your system. Many
    systems already provide binary packages for them. If your system doesn't 
    you can download Boost from http://www.boost.org and build it yourself.
    
  o SQLite3 / PostgreSQL (Advert/Replica adpaptor ONLY)
    If you want to build the SQL-based advert and replica adaptors, you will 
    need the SQLite3 and/or PostgreSQL client side libraries installed on your 
    system. Most distributions should have binary packages available. 

 
  BUILDING AND INSTALLING SAGA CORE
 
   o SAGA has a configure/make-based buildsystem. To build and install SAGA, 
     run these three commands:

      $> ./configure --prefix=/INSTALL/DIR --with-boost=/BOOST/DIR/ 
      $> make
      $> make install
      
     Note that 'make install' might require root access, depending on 
     your 'prefix' path.
 
  o Here's a list of the most important ./configure options:

    --prefix=DIR          Tells configure where to install the SAGA Core headers, 
                          libraries and command line tools. 
                          (Default: /usr/local/)

    --with-boost=DIR      Tells configure to look for the Boost C++ libraries in 
                          a location specified by DIR. If your Boost 
                          installation is in a non-standard location (i.e. not 
                          in /usr or /usr/local) or you have multiple Boost 
                          versions installed on your system, use this option.	
                          (Default: /usr/ and /usr/local/)

    --with-packages=LIST  A comma-separated list of SAGA packages to build. 
                          Possible values are job, namespace, filesystem, 
                          replica, stream, rpc, advert, sd, cpr, messages, isn, 
                          all. (Default: all)

    --with-libs=LIST      A comma-separated list that defines which library 
                          types are build. Possible values are static, dynamic, 
                          all. (Default: all)
                         
    --with-postgresql=DIR Tells configure to look for the PostgreSQL libraries 
                          and headers in the location specified by DIR. This 
                          option is required if you want to compile the SAGA 
                          Advert Adaptor with PostgreSQL support and your 
                          PostgreSQL installation is in a non-standard location.
                          (Default: /usr/ and /usr/local/)


  o For a complete list of configure options, use:

    ./configure --help=recursive
    

  INSTALLING ADDITIONAL ADAPTORS

  SAGA Core only comes with the default (local) adaptors which allow
  job execution on the local machine, local file and SQL-based
  advert and replica handling only. If you want to use additional middleware 
  adaptors, e.g. Globus, Condor or gLite, you  can download them form the 
  SAGA website and install them separately:

    http://saga-project.org/download/adaptors


  USING SAGA WITH PYTHON

  SAGA Core only comes with the native C++ API, headers and libraries. If you 
  want to use SAGA with Python, you can download and install the SAGA Python
  modules: 
  
    http://saga-project.org/download/python
