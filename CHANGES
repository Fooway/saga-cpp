  Changes with SAGA C++ Version 1.4.2                          16. April 2010
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  o We have completely restructured our code repositories. We have split up 
    SAGA into a "Core" (Engine, Packages, Default Adaptors) and into the 
    middleware adaptors. SAGA Core still lives in the same code repository,
    but the adaptors have been moved to:
    
    https://svn.cct.lsu.edu/repos/saga-adaptors.
    
    Beginning with this release, we will release Core, Python Bindings and 
    Adaptors seperately. This allows us to have individual release cycles
    for individual adaptors and components. One of the major proeblems we 
    had in the past was, that e.g. a single bug in the SSH adaptor lead to
    a completely new saga release. This won't happen anymore: now you will
    be able to download just the new release of that SSH adaptor and add it
    to your existing SAGA installation. 
    
    What do all these changes and restructuring mean for you? For you it means
    that you can't install SAGA from one source archive anymore. Yes, it 
    might have been convenient but it also caused a lot of confusions. If you
    want to install saga, you have to download and install "SAGA Core" first.
    After that, you can pick the adaptors you want and maybe the Python 
    bindings, download and install them. All Core, Adaptor and Bindings 
    releases can be found on the SAGA C++ download page:
    
    http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/software/cpp/download
    
  o Besides restructuring our code, we also found enough time to fix some
    of the bugs that were reported. Here's a list of recently closed tickets:

  Changes with SAGA C++ Version 1.2                            06. April 2009 
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  o NEW! AWS adaptors: interface to cloud services (IaaS) which implement 
    Amazons AWS interface. They instantiate and tear down Virtual Machines 
    via those services. Tested on EC2, Eucalyptus, Nimbus. Note that the 
    lifetime of the VM is configurable via the adaptor's ini file: either 
    the VM lifes onforever, or is taken down when the saga::job::service
    instance gets destroyed.
  o NEW! ssh adaptors: run jobs via ssh, and mount remote file systems 
      via sshfs. They are internally used by the aws adaptors to communicate 
      with the virtual machines created by the aws adaptors. Thus, they can 
      transparently use AWS security contexts (if invoked via AWS), and, of 
      course, plain ssh contexts.
