EXAMPLE RPC ADAPTOR
-------------------

The code in this directory shows an examplary adaptor.  The adaptor implements
the RPC API, and executes all RPC requests as shell commands.

The adaptor skeleton has been created with the saga-adaptor-generator.pl script,
via:

  saga-adaptor-generator.pl --type=rpc --name=shell --dir=.


To that skeleton, some code has been added to make the adaptor functional.  This
is supposed to demonstrate the ease of writing SAGA adaptors.  Of course, the
RPC package is, without a doubt, the simplest SAGA API package - but the same
mechanism holds for all other SAGA adaptors.
