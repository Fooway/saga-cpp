:DESCRIPTION:

:URL SCHEMES:

  - fork://


:CONFIGURE OPTIONS:

  none

:INI OPTIONS:

  none

:KNOWN ISSUES:

  Problem:
  
  The globus libs install a global signal handler.  That will screw with the
  suspend/resume operations in the local job adaptor.  For details, see
  http://faust.cct.lsu.edu/trac/saga/ticket/607.

  Workarounds:
  - don't enable the globus adaptors, unless they are really needed
  - don't suspend/resume local jobs when the globus adaptors are loaded
