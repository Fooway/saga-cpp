 A number of concepts and paradigms are used in all packages of
 the SAGA API.  The SAGA specification names these concepts as
 the \I{'SAGA Look\,\&\,Feel'}.  This section describes the most
 important concepts.

 As this section does not actually provide the reader with the means to
 perform any useful remote operation in Grids, the reader may
 want to skip this part and continue to read Part~\ref{part:packages}, and come back to this
 part as needed.
